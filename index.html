                Friends is an American sitcom television series, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, 
            which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. 
            With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, 
            Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s 
            who live in Manhattan, New York City. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane 
            Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers 
            were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane. </span>

                Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the title Insomnia Cafe between November 
             and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page 
             treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title 
             changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends. </span>

                 Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of Friends 
            ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached 
            the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, 
            and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most-watched 
            series finale in television history, and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s. </span>

                    They finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale.
